# SinK-DaT (Sino-Korean Detector and Translator)
CS372 Natural Language Processing with Python, Project, 2020 Spring

## Introduction
> from the final project report abstract


We introduce a new Korean language model called **SinK-DaT**, the **Sin**o-**K**orean (Sin-Ko) **D**etector **a**nd **T**ranslator. 
SinK-DaT provides the correct meaning and Chinese character representations of the ”difficult” Sin-Ko word based on context from a given Korean text. 
Experiments on old Korean news articles show that the model can not only detect most SinKo words, but also distinguish difficult ones among the detected Sin-Ko words and thus, supply the most suitable definitions to the users. 
As a result, Sink-DaT helps the young Korean generation in comprehending difficult corpora.
